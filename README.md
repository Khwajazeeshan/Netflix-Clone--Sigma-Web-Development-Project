**ðŸŽ¬ Netflix Clone ðŸ“º**  
This Netflix clone simulates the core interface and user experience of the official Netflix website, featuring an attractive layout that divides content into distinct sections for seamless navigation.

- **Homepage Design:** The homepage greets users with a bold, branded header showcasing the Netflix logo and a "Sign In" button linking to Netflix's login page. Below, users encounter a welcoming section with a title, a brief tagline, and a prompt to enter an email address for sign-up or login.

- **Movie and TV Show Categories:**  
  A drop-down selector allows users to filter content by country (e.g., Pakistan) and type (Movies or TV Shows). The "Trending Now" and "Only on Netflix" sections display album covers in a grid layout, each linking to the Netflix signup page for more information about each title.

- **FAQ Section:**  
  Users can access a set of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to help them understand Netflix's services better. Clicking on a question toggles the answer's visibility and switches the icon next to it between "+" and "-", using JavaScript for dynamic interactions.

- **Footer Information:**  
  At the bottom of the page, users can explore additional options, such as contacting Netflix, accessing support, managing account settings, browsing job openings, and viewing privacy policies. Language options (English and Urdu) are available to enhance accessibility.

**Interactive Elements:**  
The JavaScript adds interactivity to validate email entries in the sign-up field and control FAQ toggling. If users submit an empty or invalid email, they receive instant feedback with placeholder messages, while FAQ answers expand or collapse smoothly upon selection.
